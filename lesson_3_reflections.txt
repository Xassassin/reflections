When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When you want to share with other users, and make sure they have access when you are offline.
- Have access to your files from other machines even when your main machine is offline.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The branch your working on might change on you while you are still working on it, and your commits would not work anymore.
