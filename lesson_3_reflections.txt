When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When you want to share with other users, and make sure they have access when you are offline.
- Have access to your files from other machines even when your main machine is offline.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The branch your working on might change on you while you are still working on it, and your commits would not work anymore.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: Clones on GitHub only (clones of repos)
Clone: Copy of a remote repo
branch: Split within the same repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that you now where your commits fit within the repo.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Sending e-mails or svn

E-mails would make it really hard to fix issues everywhere with everyone for more than 2 people.
SVN covers alot of this stuf, it just makes merge near impossible to be clean
